I recently completed a Watson Fellowship, travelling to India, Nepal, and Myanmar to study the intersection of technological development and political power. Previously, I produced public radio at KQED in San Francisco and WBHM in Birmingham. Before that, I researched US Congress at The Brookings Institution. I'm a graduate of Pomona College in Los Angeles, where I studied politics and computer science.

I'm currently freelancing, primarily in audio production and political reporting.
