I'm currently making radio at [WNYC's Radiolab](https://www.wnycstudios.org/podcasts/radiolab). When I'm not making radio, I enjoy web development. My most recent project was [Don't Wait, Vote!](https://dontwait.vote/), a criminal justice ballot guide that focuses on local races. You can find those repo's below.

Previously, I completed a [Watson Fellowship](http://51.watson.foundation/fellows/eli-cohen.html), travelling to India, Nepal, and Myanmar to study the intersection of technological development and political power. I've produced public radio [WBHM](https://wbhm.org/author/eliunitedgmail-com/) in Birmingham and KQED in San Francisco. Before that, I researched US Congress at The Brookings Institution. I'm a graduate of Pomona College in Los Angeles, where I studied politics and computer science.
